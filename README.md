# FEUP_AIAD
Repository for the course "Agentes e Inteligência Artificial Distribuída" (EIC0033) of the first semester of the fourth year of MIEIC in FEUP.

In this repository there is the practical assignment of the course in the lective year of 2017/2018.

This course provides a global perspective of the associated techniques to the specification an development of computacional Agents as well as highlighting the practical relevance, by providing aplicational examples. These so called Agents are an artificial intelligence concept which has as its main objective the decentralization of a software, assigning different tasks to different entities (agents).

This project was used using JADE and Repast as well as SAJaS which is an API for JADE-based simulations, extending them to be able to communicate with Repast programs.

The theme of the project was a Traffic Management simulation in which many different concepts and characteristics needed implementation such as:
* Different types of cars
* Communication between car agents
* Notifications via the car's radio
* Q Learning algorithm
* Internal map update by observing traffic
* Internal map update by asking directions
* Navigation of a car in user-made maps
